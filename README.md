# Works Vis

This project aims to facilitate big data visualization. **Works Vis** ships with a Grafana engine to automatically build Grafana dashboards and panels e.g. from SQL statements and some extra configuration parameters.

**Works Vis** leverages a **TimescaleDB** as common visualization (backend) store and ships with connectors to multipe big data sources like **Apache Ignite**.

Code coming soon
